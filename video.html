                                must be made aware of the importance of
                                00:28
                                going into business
                                00:29

                                stopped me in my tracks I felt like he
                                00:36
                                was speaking to me now that was a

                                motivation I had needed to move forward

                                the current state and that was when I

                                01:02
                                that supporting black businesses was not
